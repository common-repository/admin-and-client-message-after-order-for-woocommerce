OrderConvo: Enable seamless post-order communication between vendors/admins and customers in WooCommerce.

==Description==
OrderConvo is a lightweight and efficient WooCommerce plugin that allows vendors and customers to exchange messages after an order is placed. Both admin/vendors and customers can send messages or files related to the order. Customers can access the OrderConvo message box from `My Account -> Orders`, where each order has its own messaging area. The plugin adds a responsive, AJAX-powered message box on the order details page, ensuring compatibility with all WooCommerce themes.

==Frequently Asked Questions==

**How can a customer send a message to the admin/vendor?**  
Once the order is placed, customers can send messages from the `My Account -> Orders` page by clicking the message button next to each order.

**Where can admins see customer messages?**  
Admins can view messages directly within the order edit page in WooCommerce.
